# DADA Invisible Economy

Start here for an overview of the Invisible Economy.

See the [modeling-simulation repo](https://github.com/InvisibleEconomy/modeling-simulation) for the Complex Systems model of the [DADA Invisible Economy](https://powerdada.medium.com/the-invisible-economy-db46897d4f07). The Colab notebooks are able to be run and played with by anyone who uses the link. Modeling is built in [cadCAD](https://cadcad.org/).

### Background & Context from the Whitepaper
DADA is an online platform where people around the world create spontaneous visual conversations together, in spite of language, distance, nationality, or other artificial boundaries. On DADA, art is a means of communication, and its creative and collaborative nature fosters strong bonds between people. Itâ€™s a free and liberating experience. Trolling and bullying are organically neutralized. It is a place where strangers make art together without expecting remuneration, motivated not by extrinsic rewards like money or status but by intrinsic rewards such as the joy of making art, and a sense of autonomy, validation, self-development, belonging and a higher purpose.

The Invisible Economy is the radical separation of art and the market. Blockchain technology allows the economy to be both invisible and transparent. It is invisible because it separates artmaking, code writing, art collecting, and general contributions from market transactions through different mechanisms. And it is transparent because all the transactions take place on the Ethereum blockchain where everyone can track them.

Blockchain allows peer-to-peer networks to launch their own currency, and to control and self-manage the value they create collectively without a central authority. The Invisible Economy organizes economic activity based on interdependence, creativity, and altruism. It leverages the wisdom of the crowd without the pernicious effects of the market. Ultimately, people are rewarded for their contributions with a basic income.
